# EC2Plant

Feel free to criticize this, I'll totally change it to an extent if you have a good enough point! 

Description: You could put your seeds in people with this. (100% could be changed)

Rarity: Beta/Alpha

Passive: Growth
[E]: Plant Grow
If you press E it makes a small plant made of leaves appear on the ground. You can have a maximum of 20 plants on the ground, with each plant placed your damage decreases by 5% (up to 50%) These plants wilt and die after like 20 seconds of their lifetime have passed.
Cooldown: 0.5s

[Q]:  Leaf Storm 
Makes 3 plants uproot and their leaves fly in the direction of the cursor, they keep going until they either hit an enemy or wilt after 2 seconds of being in the air.

First move: Vine Whip
2 vines come out of each of the plants placed, after half a second of waiting, they whip where the cursor was when it started, all dealing 2 hp in damage each. (assuming the player has set up 5 plants during a battle, when this is used successfully that would be 10 vines, meaning 20 hp of damage)
Cooldown: 2s 

Second move: Glean (Synonym for harvest, but someone already used that name for something.)
restores 3hp per placed plant in exchange for 5 seconds of the plants lifetime
Cooldown: 10s

Third move: Natureâ€™s Snare 
Sets a Venus Flytrap for the price of 3 flowers at the location of the mouse, if an enemy steps in it they will be unable to move or use most abilities for 2 seconds. this deals 10 hp in damage.
Cooldown: 7s

Fourth Move: Crushing Moss Ball
User does a backflip, summoning moss around it and creating a wheel for 10 seconds.
This wheel increases movement speed by 50%, disables all other moves and replaces Q and E with Dashing and Ground Pounding.

Move Combos
These would be activated if the player was to use moves in a specific order, effectively acting as extra moves without taking up more move slots, and having a separate cooldown to the moves used.

Vine whip > Leaf Storm - Vine Throw : 10 hp dealt in damage, launches enemy into the sky.
Nature's Snare > Enemy Trapped > Glean - Drain : 40 HP Dealt in damage, 20 HP Recovered for user.
